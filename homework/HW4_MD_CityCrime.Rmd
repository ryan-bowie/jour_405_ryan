title: "HW4 MD CityCrime"
---

In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset of total crimes reported by Maryland cities for two consecutive years. You'll load the data, calculate the violent and property crime rates for each city for both years, and then calculate the percentage change in the crime rates between the two years. You'll also write a short story based on your findings.

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse and Janitor

You will need to load the tidyverse library and the janitor library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)
```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv. You will create a dataframe called `md_cities` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data

```{r}
crimes <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv")
```
### Task 3: Calculating Rates

Calculate violent and property crime rates for each city for both years using `mutate()`. You'll create four new columns: `violent_rate_2019`, `property_rate_2019`, `violent_rate_2020`, and `property_rate_2020`. You'll need to figure out the proper unit rate, given that there are varying populations. There's no perfect choice; choose the one that works best for you. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_rates`.

```{r}
md_cities_rates <- crimes |> mutate(
  violent_rate_2019 = (violent2019/pop2019) * 100000, 
  propery_rate_2019 = (property2019/pop2019)*100000, 
  violent_rate_2020 = (violent2020/pop2020)*100000, 
  property_rate_2020 = (property2020/pop2020)*100000
)
```

### Task 4: Describe the Rates

Examine the new dataframe, `md_cities_rates`, by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio and sorting by the rate columns. Write a couple of sentences about the results, comparing and contrasting the cities with the highest rates (both violent and property) in 2019 and 2020. Do you see any patterns? What does this tell you about crime in Maryland cities? What's the story here?

Baltimore and Ocean City are two cities that are the highest in both violent crime and property crime in 2019 and 2020. For Baltimore, it makes sense since it is the most populous city in the state and has ranked top 10 as one of the most dangerous cities in America for many years. In the case of Ocean City, the population is nowhere near the number that Baltimore has, yet the violent crime and property crime rates are higher than every other city in Maryland besides Baltimore. This tells me that the crime being committed in Ocean City is most likely tourist-related crime. The story would be Ocean City having a higher overall crime rate than Baltimore.


### Task 5: Calculate Percentage Change

Let's add two percentage change columns to your dataframe: one for violent crime rates and one for property crime rates. You'll calculate the percentage change between 2019 and 2020 for each city. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_change`.

```{r}
md_cities_change <- md_cities_rates |> 
  mutate(
    violent_pct_change = ((violent_rate_2020 - violent_rate_2019) / violent_rate_2019) * 100,
    property_pct_change = ((property_rate_2020 - propery_rate_2019) / propery_rate_2019) * 100
  )

```

### Task 7: Describe Percentage Changes

Look at the `md_cities_change` dataframe by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the percentage change results. What's more interesting here, the patterns or the outliers? What's the story in the data?

The most interesting thing about this dataframe is the patterns, considering that crime in Ocean City is worse than crime in Baltimore. Despite the high crime rate on both the violent and property side, the crime in Baltimore actually decreased by almost 13% in violent crime and over 25% in property crime. For Ocean City, there was an 82.9% increase in violent crime and a 17% increase in property crime. 

### Task 8: Tell the Best Story

Write up a lede and nutgraf of a story with the _best_ story idea you've found in this assignment. The lede should be a single sentence that summarizes the most important information in the data. The nutgraf should be a paragraph that provides more context and explains why the data is important.

Violent and property crime in Ocean City soared past Baltimore, the most populous city in Maryland, in just one year.

According to statistics, violent crime in Ocean City has risen by over 80 percent in the past year. In Baltimore, a city perennially ranked as one of the most dangerous cities in America, violent crime decreased by almost 15 percent.

### Task 9: Save Your Work and Put it on GitHub

Save this notebook, then commit it to your local repository. Push the changes to your GitHub repository and submit the URL for this file in ELMS.
