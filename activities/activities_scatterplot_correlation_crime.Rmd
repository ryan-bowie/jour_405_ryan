Activity #1:

Examine this New York Times scatterplot from 2013:
https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/07/education/college-admissions-gap.html?_r=0

The graphic displays four different scatterplots showing relationships between student demographics and college acceptance rates. For each of the four scatterplots:

a) Describe the relationship (or lack thereof) between the two variables.


b) Note the specific words and phrases the graphic uses to characterize each relationship.


Write 1-2 sentences summarizing each scatterplot.

Name each person in your group who worked on this entry.



**Write Answer #1:**

Ryan, Luke, Lauren

There is a weak negative correlation for the first three scatterplots, this means that as graduation rate increases, the percentage of Black students and Hispanic students slightly decreases, meaning there is a negative correlation. Since the dots aren't close together, the relationship is also weak. The fourth scatterplot representing Asian students shows a weak positive correlation meaning that as the graduation rate increases, the percentage of Asian students slightly tends to follow suit. For the first graphic it uses "almost as likely" and "half as likely" to describe the weak negative correlation.

Activity #2: Correlation Demonstration

In the following exercise, we will look at data about 16 different consultants, their aptitude scores and their performance scores.

Our question: what is the relationship between a consultant's aptitude and their performance? 

How are they correlated?

Below we calculate a Pearson's correlation coefficient and then create a regression line.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Load data for aptitude and performance for 16 different consultants
```{r}
aptitude <- c(45, 81, 65, 87, 68, 91, 77, 61, 55, 66, 82, 93, 76, 83, 61, 74)
performance <- c(56, 74, 56, 81, 75, 84, 68, 52, 57, 82, 73, 90, 67, 79, 70, 66)
consultant <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16)
#this builds our table
consultants <- data.frame(consultant, aptitude, performance)
consultants
```


### Task 1: Use `summarize()` and the `cor()` function to calculate the correlation between aptitude and performance, using the pearson method.

```{r}
consultants |> summarize(correlation = cor(aptitude, performance, method="pearson"))
```

We see a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.783.
What does that mean?

The Pearson correlation scale is from -1 to 1.
-1 is a perfect negative correlation
1 is a perfect positive correlation

How do we interpret the values in between?

-- High Degree: Values between ±0.50 and ±1 suggest a strong correlation.
-- Moderate Degree: Values between ±0.30 and ±0.49 indicate a moderate correlation.
-- Low Degree: Values below +0.29 are considered a weak correlation.
-- No Correlation: A value of zero implies no relationship.

**Question: How would you describe the 0.783 correlation between aptitute and performance?**

**A: Write your answer:**

The correlation between aptitude and performance is generally strong since it is above 0.50.


### Task 2: Create a scatterplot of aptitude and performance, using `geom_point()`

```{r}

consultants |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=aptitude, y=performance)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=aptitude, y=performance), method="lm") +
  expand_limits(x = 0, y = 0)

```


The "best fit" line is known as a regression line that helps us understand the relationship between two variables. This predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variable. 

A regression line is a straight line showing a best-fit between independent and dependent variables.

In the example above, aptitude would be the independent variable, or the predictor. That's because we would expect aptitude to predict performance, which is the dependent variable, or the outcome variable.

Independent = predictor
Dependent = outcome

Regression is one step ahead of correlation. It helps predict the values of dependent variables or outcomes with respect to changes in independent or explanatory variables. 

Regression lines help predict outcomes.

Activity #3: 

# PG Murders and Heat

Let's explore the relationship between crime and hot weather using homicide and temperature data from Prince George's County. 

You'll load the data, perform some basic statistical analysis, and create a scatterplot to explore the relationship. Follow the steps below to complete the assignment.

### Task 1: Load the tidyverse

**write code below**
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


### Task 2: Load the dataset from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/pg_murder_temps.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/pg_murder_temps.csv)

**write code below**
```{r}
murder_temps <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/pg_murder_temps.csv")
```



### Task 3: Use `summarize()` and the `cor()` function to calculate the correlation between murders and temperature, using the pearson method.

**write code below**
```{r}
murder_temps |> summarize(correlation = cor(murders, temperature, method="pearson"))
  
```



### Task 4: Create a scatterplot of murders and temperature, using `geom_point()`. Your aes() will have temperatures on the x axis, murders on the y axis and add a label for the month (so label=month inside the aes()).

**write code below**
```{r}
murder_temps |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=temperature, y=murders)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=temperature, y=murders), method="lm") +
  geom_text(aes(x=temperature, y=murders, label=month)) +
  labs(title = "Murders vs Temperature")
  
```


### Task 5: Add labels to the scatterplot using geom_text(). Inside geom_text() put the same aes() as geom_point in Task 4, then after the aes() add size = 5.

**write code below**
```{r}
murder_temps |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=temperature, y=murders)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=temperature, y=murders), method="lm") +
  geom_text(aes(x=temperature, y=murders, label=month), size = 5) +
  labs(title = "Murders vs Temperature")
  
```


### Task 6: Describe the results of both the correlation calculation and the scatterplot.

**Write Answer:**

The correlation calculation is a weak positive correlation because the correlation is slightly over 0.50 and the data points are not close to the line of regression. However the line is slopes upwards from left to right, indicating a positive correlation.
